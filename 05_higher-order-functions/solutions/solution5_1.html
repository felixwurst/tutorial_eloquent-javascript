    <!-- Flattening

    Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays. -->

    <script>
      let arr = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9],
      ];

      console.log(arr.reduce((flat, current) => flat.concat(current), []));
      // -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    </script>
  </body>
