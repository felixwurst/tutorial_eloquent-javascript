    <!-- Itâ€™s traditional for platform games to have the player start with a limited number of lives and subtract one life each time they die. When the player is out of lives, the game restarts from the beginning.

    Adjust runGame to implement lives. Have the player start with three. Output the current number of lives (using console.log) every time a level starts. -->
