    <!-- Finding paths

    Write the findPath function, which, like the one in Chapter 7, attempts to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It should take two GraphNode objects (like the one we used in this chapter) as arguments and return either null if no path is to be found, or an array of the nodes that represent a path through the graph. Nodes that are adjacent in this array are said to be connected by an edge.
    
    A good algorithm for finding a path in a graph is as follows:
    
    1. Create a worklist containing a single path, where this path again consists only of the starting node.
    2. Start with the first path in the worklist.
    3. If the node at the end of the current path is the destination node, return the path.
    4. Otherwise, create a new path for each unexamined neighbor of the node at the end of the path (that is, for each neighbor that is not at the end of any of the paths in the worklist). To do this, add the neighbor to the current path and add it to the worklist. 
    5. If there are several paths in the worklist, go to the next path and continue with step 3.
    6. Otherwise there is no path.
    
    By fanning out from the start node, this procedure ensures that the destination node is always reached via the shortest path, since longer paths are not considered until the shorter ones have already been explored.
    
    Implement this program and test it with some simple tree graphs. Construct a graph with a cyclic connection (e.g., using the connect method to add edges to a tree graph) and see if your function finds the shortest path when there are multiple possibilities. -->

      // first working version
      // function findPath(from, to) {
      //   let work = [{at: from, route: [from]}];
      //   for (let i = 0; i < work.length; i++) {
      //     let {at, route} = work[i];
      //     if (route[route.length - 1] == to) return route;
      //     for (let edge of at.edges) {
      //       if (!work.some(w => w.route[route.length - 1] == edge)) {
      //         work.push({at: edge, route: route.concat(edge)});
      //       }
      //     }
      //   }
      // }

      // optimized version
      function findPath(a, b) {
        // the worklist contains only one path at the beginning, consisting of the start node
        let work = [[a]];
        for (let path of work) {
          let end = path[path.length - 1];
          // the path is returned if the last node of the examined path corresponds to the destination node
          if (end == b) return path;
          // the neighbors of the last node of the path are examined
          for (let next of end.edges) {
            // the neighbor is placed at the end of the path, if it is not already doing so for any other path
            if (!work.some(path => path[path.length - 1] == next)) {
              work.push(path.concat([next]));
            }
          }
        }
      }

      let graph = treeGraph(4, 4);
      let root = graph[0],
        leaf = graph[graph.length - 1];
      console.log(findPath(root, leaf).length);
      // → 4

      leaf.connect(root);
      console.log(findPath(root, leaf).length);
      // → 2

      runLayout(forceDirected_noVector, graph);
