    <!-- Timing

    Use Date.now() to measure how long it takes your findPath function to find a path in a more complicated graph. Since treeGraph puts the root at the beginning of the graph array and a leaf at the end, you can give your function a nontrivial task in the following way:

    let graph = treeGraph(6, 6);
    console.log(findPath(graph[0], graph[graph.length - 1]).length);
    // → 6
  
    Construct a test case with a runtime of about half a second. Be careful when passing larger numbers to treeGraph. Since the size of the graph increases exponentially, this can easily make the graph so large that it takes a lot of time and memory to find a path in it. -->

    <script>
      function findPath(a, b) {
        let work = [[a]];
        for (let path of work) {
          let end = path[path.length - 1];
          if (end == b) return path;
          for (let next of end.edges) {
            if (!work.some(path => path[path.length - 1] == next)) {
              work.push(path.concat([next]));
            }
          }
        }
      }

      function time(findPath) {
        let graph = treeGraph(6, 6);
        let startTime = Date.now();
        // treeGraph puts the root at the beginning of the graph array and a leaf at the end
        let result = findPath(graph[0], graph[graph.length - 1]);
        console.log(
          `Path with a length of ${result.length} was found in ${
            Date.now() - startTime
          } ms`
        );
      }

      time(findPath);
      // → Path with a length of 4 was found in 2 ms
      // → Path with a length of 5 was found in 17 ms
      // → Path with a length of 6 was found in 859 ms
