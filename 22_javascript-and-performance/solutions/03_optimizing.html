    <!-- Optimizing

    Now that you have measurements for a test case, try to find ways to make findPath faster.

    Consider both macro-optimization (doing less work) and micro-optimization (doing the given work in a less costly way). Also look for ways to use less memory and allocate fewer or smaller data structures. -->

    <script>
      function time(findPath) {
        let graph = treeGraph(6, 6);
        let startTime = Date.now();
        let result = findPath(graph[0], graph[graph.length - 1]);
        console.log(
          `Path with a length of ${result.length} was found in ${
            Date.now() - startTime
          } ms`
        );
      }

      // not optimized version
      function findPath(a, b) {
        let work = [[a]];
        for (let path of work) {
          let end = path[path.length - 1];
          if (end == b) return path;
          for (let next of end.edges) {
            if (!work.some(path => path[path.length - 1] == next)) {
              work.push(path.concat([next]));
            }
          }
        }
      }
      // time(findPath);
      // → Path with a length of 6 was found in 859 ms

      // macro-optimization (doing less work)
      // Previously, the worklist was scanned to see if the node is already there. Now, the nodes that have already been looked at are placed in a set. This check is considerably faster.
      function findPath_set(a, b) {
        let work = [[a]];
        let reached = new Set([a]);
        for (let path of work) {
          let end = path[path.length - 1];
          if (end == b) return path;
          for (let next of end.edges) {
            if (!reached.has(next)) {
              reached.add(next);
              work.push(path.concat([next]));
            }
          }
        }
      }
      // time(findPath_set);
      // → Path with a length of 6 was found in 23 ms

      // micro-optimization (doing the given work in a less costly way)
      // Previously, for the array of the path was extended with the method concat, thereby the entire array is copied.
      // Now the data structure of a list is used, where several extensions of a list can share common data.
      // The paths are stored in an object with the properties at and via, where at is the last node in the path and via is another object of this type with the rest of the path.
      // path {at: GraphNode, via: {at: GraphNode, via: {at: GraphNode, via: null}}}
      // To extend a path, it is now only necessary to create an object with these two properties instead of copying an entire array.

      // The list, before being returned, is converted into a real array
      function pathToArray(path) {
        let result = [];
        for (; path; path = path.via) {
          result.unshift(path.at);
        }
        return result;
      }

      function findPath_list(a, b) {
        let work = [{at: a, via: null}];
        let reached = new Set([a]);
        for (let path of work) {
          if (path.at == b) return pathToArray(path);
          for (let next of path.at.edges) {
            if (!reached.has(next)) {
              reached.add(next);
              work.push({at: next, via: path});
            }
          }
        }
      }
      time(findPath_list);
      // → Path with a length of 6 was found in 17 ms
