# Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```javascript
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

```javascript
let abc = 'abc';
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3
```
