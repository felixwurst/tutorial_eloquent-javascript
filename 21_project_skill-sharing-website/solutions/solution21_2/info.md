# Comment field resets

The wholesale redrawing of talks works pretty well because you usually canâ€™t tell the difference between a DOM node and its identical replacement. But there are exceptions. If you start typing something in the comment field for a talk in one browser window and then, in another, add a comment to that talk, the field in the first window will be redrawn, removing both its content and its focus.

In a heated discussion, where multiple people are adding comments at the same time, this would be annoying. Can you come up with a way to solve it?
