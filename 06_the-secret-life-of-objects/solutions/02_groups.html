    <!-- Groups

    The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called Set. Like an instance of Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does not associate other values with those—it just tracks which values are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn’t have any effect.

    Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a member), delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

    Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

    Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it. -->

    <script>
      class Group {
        constructor() {
          this.members = [];
        }
        add(value) {
          if (!this.has(value)) this.members.push(value);
          // return this.members;
        }
        delete(value) {
          if (this.has(value))
            this.members = this.members.filter(item => item !== value);
          // return this.members;
        }
        has(value) {
          return this.members.includes(value);
        }
        static from(...values) {
          const group = new Group();
          for (const value of values) {
            group.add(value);
          }
          return group;
        }
      }

      const group = Group.from(1, 5);

      console.log(group.has(1));
      // -> true
      console.log(group.has(2));
      // -> false
      group.add(2);
      console.log(group.has(2));
      // -> true
      group.delete(2);
      console.log(group.has(2));
      // -> false
    </script>
