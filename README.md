# Tutorials: Eloquent JavaScript

Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd edition (2018).
Written by Marijn Haverbeke.

This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. You can read it online [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), or buy your own [paperback copy](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1593279507?geniuslink=true).

Each chapter contains tasks to solve. My own results can be found in the solutions folders of the respective chapters.
