    <!-- Write a program that draws the following shapes on a canvas:

    1. A trapezoid (a rectangle that is wider on one side)

    2. A red diamond (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians)

    3. A zigzagging line

    4. A spiral made up of 100 straight line segments
    
    5. A yellow star

    When drawing the last two, you may want to refer to the explanation of Math.cos and Math.sin in Chapter 14, which describes how to get coordinates on a circle using these functions.

    I recommend creating a function for each shape. Pass the position, and optionally other properties such as the size or the number of points, as parameters. The alternative, which is to hard-code numbers all over your code, tends to make the code needlessly hard to read and modify. -->

    <canvas width="600" height="200"></canvas>
    <script>
      let cx = document.querySelector('canvas').getContext('2d');

      function trapezoid(widthTop, widthBottom, height) {
        cx.beginPath();
        cx.moveTo((widthBottom - widthTop) / 2, 0);
        cx.lineTo((widthBottom - widthTop) / 2 + widthTop, 0);
        cx.lineTo(widthBottom, height);
        cx.lineTo(0, height);
        cx.closePath();
        cx.stroke();
      }
      trapezoid(50, 100, 50);

      cx.fillStyle = 'red';
      cx.rotate((2 * Math.PI) / 8);
      cx.fillRect(120, 0, 50, 50);
